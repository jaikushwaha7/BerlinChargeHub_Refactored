## Electric Charging Stations and Residents Heatmap
The **Electric Charging Stations and Residents Heatmap** is an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** and **Folium**. It provides a user-friendly interface to visualize electric vehicle charging station locations, residential density, and demand scores on an interactive map.
### Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and logout functionality for accessing the app.
- **Search by Postal Code**: Quickly find charging station information for specific postal codes.
- **Interactive Heatmaps**: Visualize various data layers, including:
    - Residential population density.
    - Electric charging station availability.
    - Demand scores for charging stations.
    - Charging station ratings.

- **Dynamic Demand Calculation**: Calculate demand scores using population, station count, and usage rates.
- **Customizable Map Layers**: Toggle between data layers dynamically for tailored insights.

### Use Cases
- **City Planners**: Identify areas with low charging station availability to guide resource allocation.
- **Business Analysts**: Evaluate the best locations to set up new charging stations.
- **EV Users**: Check charging station availability and ratings in your area.

### Getting Started
1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the app with `streamlit run src/app/create_heatmap.py`.
3. Interact with the map, search stations by postal code, and explore data layers.
